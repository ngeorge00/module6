            <h2>Greetings! Salutations!</h2>This is my home page about me! I have never done something like this before, and to be entirely honest, I am quite anxious. I think I may have bitten off more than I can 		chew regarding this class, but isn't life all about trial and error? Anyways, enough about me blabbing about my woes and being all meta and mopey. Welcome! I hope this meager site is to your 			satisfaction! <i>Alexa, play "Just Can't Get Enough" by Depeche Mode. </i>

            <h2>About Me</h2>Oh hello there! Figured I would put down some bits and pieces about me in here. My name is Noah (obviously). I was born and raised in the city of Detroit, spent a lot of time fishing and kayaking through the Great Lakes and the many rivers we got here. Beautiful country, when the winter winds aren't freezing our butts off. If you ever come to Michigan, I recommend checking out the town of Holland to the West, and the town of Petoskey, to the North. Great scenery, lots to do and see, and plenty of eating/drinking spots! I got a dad, two sisters (both married to military men), and two dogs! (See the Dogs page for them). I work as a Youth Librarian in my village's Library, and am currently aspiring to be an archivist! I think that's all I'll share for now.
