        <h2>The Dogs</h2>
        <p>Behold! These are the two goobers who keep me sane in these particular insane times. To the left is Henry, a Bernedoodle. To the right is Maggie, a Goldendoodle. These two absolute love joys keep me warm, active, and a bit crazy at times. But I love them dearly. Starting with Maggie, we got her about three years ago. She has more energy than an atomic bomb, constantly wants to play and run about. She is extremely social, always hanging around a human or Henry, never alone by herself. She demands no less than three walks a day and doesn't care for food. Her favorite game is surprisingly hide and seek. She knows all my hiding spots, unfortunately. </p>
        <p>Henry, on the other hand, is very much a diva. He cares more about sleeping the day away and eating our food. Unlike Maggie, he is very much NOT a social dog. In fact, he wants nothing to do with her, while she bounces around him. He is about six years old, but very much as lively as he was a puppy. While he doesn't care for hide and seek, he is very much a swimmer, which Maggie is not. So in short, these two couldn't be further apart in personality. Do they love each other? Probably not.</p>
