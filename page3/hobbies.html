            <p>My hobbies are few, but everyone's got their favorite things. As indicated by the picture, I am quite the sucker for classic baseball. I'll always root for the Detroit Tigers, even though the Ownership stinks and keeps throttling our potential. But the game is always exciting to me, so I stick by them thick and thin. As mentioned on my home page, I have quite an interest in archery, and was taught by a friend how to do it on horseback. Trust me, it is much, much, harder than it looks on video or TV. I am by no means any good, but it is really satisfying when you pull off a shot. Cooking is another thing I love to do and I must say, I am not too shabby at all. Just very slow.</p>
	    <p>Growing up in Michigan means you are surrounded by lakes, big and small, rivers, and ponds. So I had a lot of exposure to kayaking and fishing. There is a river here called the Hudson, and it is one of my favorites to kayak downstream. Friends and I will spend an entire day, literally, on going down several miles on the Hudson, sometimes fishing while we do so. As mentioned in the dogs page, my dog Henry loves the water, so I take him out on boat rides during the summer and he often likes to jump off and swim around to his leisure. </p>
